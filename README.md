# DataScienceProjects
This is where I start trying on some projects from various online learning platforms, mainly Datacamp and Kaggle.
I found that in my economics courses, we are taught to analyze the data and interpret its output, but never learn 
how to perform the essential works to data in order the make them readable for computer programs. Therefore, 
I started sourcing online projects to apply the knowledge and skills I have learnt that is related to data science.

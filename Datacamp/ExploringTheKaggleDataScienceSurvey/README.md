# Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey

This is my first project that is related to data science. Basically it warms me up for future
data science projects. Luckily, Datacamp provides guided projects that is very beginner-friendly,
especially for me who has zero experience. However, this 
leads to a problem that is the learner would be just simply following the instructions without
knowing why we need to perform such action. This project is a good example for that, as it doesn't 
emphasize on the interpretation of the output. Therefore, I decided to write a summary for 
the project and break it down by section. Doing this isn't only for other viewers'
better understanding, but also to ensure me that I know how and why the process is done.

## Section 1 (Setup)
- Load necessary libraries/packages into the space and read the data.
- Take a glance into the dataset to get a basic idea of the data structure in the dataset, 
and of course, check if there is any missing value.

## Section 2 (Identify Variable of Interests, Data Manipulation)
- Here, we identify our column of interests and analyze it (In this case, we are interested in the tools used by the scientists).
- Perform manipulations on the column in order to make our next step easier.

## Section 3 (Data Manipulation)
- Count each tool that is used and locate those with the highest frequency of use.

## Section 4 (Data Visualization)
- Use visualization tools to help us get a better understanding at the frequency of tools used.

## Section 5 (Data Manipulation)
- Now, we zoom in to 2 tools that are mostly used, which are R and Python.
- We do data manipulation to further record down how many people are using R and Python.

## Section 6 (Data Visualization)
- Again, use visualization tools to help us gain a clearer understanding of how these tools distributed.

## Section 7 (Data Manipulation)
- We then take their recommendations into account and see which one has been recommended most.

## Section 8 (Data Visualization)
- Use visualization tools to see the count of recommendations.

## Section 9
- Complete.

*tools used: R, dplyr, ggplot, tidyverse*
